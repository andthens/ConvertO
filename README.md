This code is designed to process a SIF (Structured Information File) and update the values of the NAME attributes within both the Integration Component and Integration Component Fields sections. Specifically, it will replace these values with the appropriate XML tags that correspond to each element.

##HOW TO USE?
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open Command Prompt (CMD).
3. Navigate to the repository folder
  
      **cd <path_to_repository>**

4. Run the script:

      **ConvertO.py**

5. When prompted, enter the name of the SIF file you want to convert, including the file extension (e.g., demo1.sif).
   
6. Press Enter.

The output file will be saved in the same directory as the original file, with the prefix updated_ added to the file name.
